# Project's Target/Goal
This Project aims to explore assembly language and x86 real mode (in general). The guidelines that will be followed throughout the project are available [here](documents/project_guidelines.pdf).

# Target Platform
This project is compiled using aims to be independent of any operating system and relies mainly on interrupts provided by BIOS on x86 systems (provided in [Ralf Brown's list of interrupts](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ralf/files.html) which comprises of not-only BIOS interrupts but those offered by the operating system too).

The project however might resort to using os specific interrupts (mostly dos-specific) throughout the development phase but the usage of such interrupts will be temporary until a better solution is found/written. Any os-specific piece of code used will always be mentioned under [here](#os-specific-stuff-used).
